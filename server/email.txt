Good Morning Doke,

My name is Will - I’m a student with FREAS IT here at UD.  We are working on implementing dashboards for some of our departments in FREAS, and currently are faced with providing a solution that includes loading a webview of gjallarhorn.nss.udel.edu.  We are currently leveraging access thru the ‘ro’ account, but would like to create a custom view that implements a rotation and scaling method (to fit the dashboard display).

Is there any way we could have access to create this view / and or layer css overtop the page to provide rotating and scaling functionality?

Thanks!

Will
